Short Assignment_201
Objective:
Able to install the compilation, execution environment and write the first java program.
Run an application based on Java technology from the command line
Exercise 1: Data type and Operators
Specifications   

Write a Java program to find the value of specified expression.

a) 101 + 0) / 3
b) 3.0e-6 * 10000000.1
c) true && true
d) false && true
e) (false && false) || (true && true)
f) (false || false) && (true && true)
Output

(101 + 0) / 3)-> 33

(3.0e-6 * 10000000.1)-> 30.0000003

(true && true)-> true

(false && true)-> false

((false && false) || (true && true))-> true

(false || false) && (true && true)-> false

 

 

Exercise 2: Logical Operators
Specifications   

Write a Java program to enter four integer numbers and prints equal if all four are equal, and not equal otherwise.

Output                                        

Input first number: 101

Input second number: 122

Input third number: 123

Input fourth number: 111

Numbers are not equal!

Exercise 4: Arithmetic Operators
Specifications

Write a Java programs, called CylinderComputation to print the surface area, base area, and volume of a cylinder, given its radius and height (in doubles).

You should use 5 double variables called radius, height, surfaceArea, baseArea and volume. Take note that space (blank) is not allowed in variable names.

Output

Surface area = 1295.906968125

Base area = 490.8738515625

Volume = 1963.49540625
